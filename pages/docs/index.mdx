# Introduction
Firefiles is a SaaS which allows you to setup your own personal file hosting service by using Firebase's Cloud Storage. Currently, Firefiles only supports Firebase but we have plans to add more services in the future.

Firefiles basically provides you with a Google Drive like experience for your storage bucket.
