# Deploying your Firefiles Instance

It is now time to deploy our own Firefiles instance.

## Deploying with Vercel

We will use [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=firefiles&utm_medium=docs) to deploy our instance. However, you can use any other hosting service which supports Next.js. Go ahead and create an account on Vercel if you haven't already. (It's free!)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffaisalsayed10%2Ffirefiles%2Ftree%2Fself-host&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,CIPHER_KEY,FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY&envDescription=API%20keys%20and%20credentials%20required%20for%20the%20instance%20to%20work.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Ffirefiles.vercel.app%2Fdocs%2Fself-hosted%2F02-deploy&project-name=my-firefiles-instance&repo-name=my-firefiles-instance&redirect-url=https%3A%2F%2Ffayd.me%2Ffirefiles-selfhost)

Click on the button above. You will be asked to provide your Firebase credentials. To find these credentials, go to your project console and click on the settings icon on the top left. If you scroll a bit down in the `General` tab, you'll find your config values!

Add these values one by one in the Environment variables asked to deploy the project.

Now there are 3 more environment variables that you need to configure. (`CIPHER_KEY`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`)

The `CIPHER_KEY` should be a strong and randomly generated 32 characters string. You can use a service like a random password generator to generate this key.

Now, inorder to get `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, you need to go to your Firebase console, click on the cog wheel on top-left and select `Project Settings`. Navigate to the `Service Accounts` section and click on the `Generate new private key` button.

This will download a `.json` file which will contain your client email and the private key. Copy and paste the values of `client_email` and `private_key` from the json into the respective fields in vercel.

And finally, click on the `Deploy` button!

You can configure the domain of your instance in Vercel's project settings. And now you can login to your instance and start using Firefiles!
