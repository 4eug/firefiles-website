# Setup

Let's first setup our Firebase project. (This guide is beginner-friendly, so if you have 0 experience with Firebase, you'll still be able to follow along.)

## Creating a new Firebase project

**Note:** Skip this step if you already have a Firebase project.

1. Go to [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. Click on the `+ Add Project` button.

3. Give your project a name, and on the next page, disable Google Analytics if not required.

4. Click on `Create` and wait for your project to get created.

5. Once created, you'll need to configure your project for each platform. However, we only need to worry about configuring the `Web` platform. To do this, click on the `</>` icon in the console.

6. Once you get to the `Add Firebase SDK` section, copy and store your config values.

Once this is done, let's move to setting up our cloud storage. Click on the `Storage` section in the sidebar and click on `Get Started`. Select `Production Mode` when asked to select the type of mode to use. Firebase will now ask you to select a location for your bucket. Select the one which is closer to you.

**NOTE:** Once the location is selected, it cannot be changed again. Upload/Download speeds depend on the selected location and your location.
