# Important things to note

## Authentication

We currently have a system where we create a temporary user in your Firebase project through which we are able to access your storage bucket.
In order for this to work properly, make sure you have enabled `Email/Password` authentication in your Firebase project.

![firebase-email-auth](/firebase-auth-enabled.png)

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
	Quick Fix: <br /> If you're getting any errors regarding authentication such as `Wrong Password`
	etc. (only for the temporary user). Head over to the `Authentication` section and delete the user
	which Firefiles would have created.
</Callout>

The email of the temporary user will be something like --> `youremail+firefiles@yourdomain.com`. This is because any email to that address will be redirected to your original email. (basically Gmail ignores anything after `+` and before `@`).  
And the password will be a randomly generated string. Even we don't know what the password will be.

---
Once, you reach this point, open up Firefiles, click on the `Create New Drive` button and create a new drive with your Firebase credentials. Once the drive is created, open that drive once, wait for a few seconds (maybe 10?) and then close it.

After this, you'll see the user we were talking about in the `Authentication` tab in Firebase. Copy the `uid` because we'll need it ahead!

## Security Rules

You'll need to tweak the security rules of your storage bucket so that Firefiles can work properly.
The security rules which would work are:

![default-security-rules](/firebase-default-rules.png)

OR

![custom-security-rules](/firebase-security-rules.png)

The latter one is more secure and prevents other users in your database from getting access to your storage.  
**NOTE:** On line 5 in the above image, change the `uid` to the `uid` of the user which will be created by Firefiles. (Get the `uid` from the `Authentication` section of your Firebase project).
