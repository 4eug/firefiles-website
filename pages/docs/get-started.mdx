# Get Started

You mainly have two options for using Firefiles:

1. Either you host it yourself (Self-Host)
2. Or we host the app for you and you can use it right away (Hosted).

## Hosted vs Self-Host

Let's see what are the differences between self-hosting your own instance or using a hosted instance.

|             | Hosted                           | Self-Host                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| What is it? | We manage the Firefiles instance | You host your own instance |
| Features    | All                              | All                        |
| Pricing     | Free (while in beta)             | Free                       |
| Security    | Config encrypted with AES-256    | Config stays with you      |
| Background  | Ideal for everyone               | Ideal for technical people |
| Support     | Free                             | Free                       |

We have everything documented here for both the options. However, if you're still facing any issues, please feel free to reach out to us by [emailing us](mailto://firefiles-support@fayd.me) or by creating an issue at our [Github page](https://github.com/faisalsayed10/firefiles)
